Hello! I'm Ryan Walker, a passionate Software Engineer with a unique journey and a love for tackling new challenges.

## About Me
With a sociology degree in my hand I started my career volunteering for AmeriCorps and working in non-profits in Pittsburgh. From there I was able to pursue a dream of being a touring musician and traveling the USA. Eventually, my curiousity and desire for a new challenge led me back to school to code. I have spent the last 5 years working at RVshare as a software engineer working in all areas of our codebase. Getting to this place in my journey has been exciting and fullfilling because I can be creative, work to make a positive impact, constantly be challenged, and solve problems.
